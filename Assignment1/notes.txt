1) Solve for for L and U according to slide LU5
QUESTION: since we know L = L_transpose, do we use a faster algorithm, possibly one from the next slides (with pivot and all)?

2) Solve for y in Ly=B. Since L is a triangular matrix, you start by getting y_i of the row that only has one L entry, then move up to get all the other ys.

[ L L L ][ y ] = [ b ]
[ 0 L L ][ y ] = [ b ]
[ 0 0 L ][ y ] = [ b ] < = Start here

See slides for exact formula for each y_i

3) Now that you have y, you can find x in Ux=y.

See slides for exact formula for each x_i
